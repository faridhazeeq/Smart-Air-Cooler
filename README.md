- Abdillah Safwan Bin Yusop 		(B031910120)
- Muhammad Ridhwan Bin Razalee 		(B031910197)
- Farid Hazeeq Bin Burhanuddin 		(B031910427)


- [ ] **Objectives:**
The objective for this project are mainly for
- Reduce amount of workload needed to adjust fan position
- Create a small portable cooling fan just like a mini air-conditioner
- The fan will automatically target person/moving object using a camera.
- Increase efficiency of the power and air-cold as normal fan will only blow in static or sometime it rotate when there is no person standing there.  


##  B. ABSTRACT 

Currently the temperature in Malaysia now are soaring high as the weather in today world are increasing rapidly from time to time. This become major problem for Malaysia and also to those nation in the earth equator line (Khatulistiwa). Highest recorded temperature in malaysia are 36.4 degree celcius on February 2021, potentially making the coming weeks blistering hot. Moreover, based on the news taken from TheStar and BHarian, MetMalaysia director-general Jailan Simon said the country is currently in the last phase of the northeast monsoon season that will last until mid-March.

During this period, he said, rainfall is expected to be low in Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the northern region. Those people who working on air-conditioner place will not have much trouble of ii but what happen to the people that dont have air-conditioner at the work place. As we know, heat place may reduce our energy to work efficently, especially during this MCO time due to Covid-19 happen on 2021 now, where most people work at home and which is most poeple dont have air-conditioner like their office.

Due to that, our team decide to make a Smart Air Cooling to solve this problem. Of course, we know that there a lot of product out there selling the air cooling fan. But this is not a normal type air cooler. It is a smart air cooler which user AI technology to automatically blow cool air toward the person. The Idea is to make a fan with servo to automatically targeting the nearest person posibble based on AI movement tracking or Person tracking depending on situation.

This is a small project that combining IoT and AI together to make a small scale air cooling which automatically blow the cold air toward the target user.

Figure 1 shows the static fan blow only on straight where user need to stand in front of it.


## C.  DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

- Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
- Detect face masks in real-time video streams

We’ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our face mask detector.


There is two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector as shown in Figure 2:

![Figure 2](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/face_mask_detection_phases.png)
Figure 2: Phases and individual steps for building a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision and deep learning 

In order to train a custom face mask detector, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps (as shown by Figure 1 above):

- Training: Here we’ll focus on loading our face mask detection dataset from disk, training a model (using Keras/TensorFlow) on this dataset, and then serializing the face mask detector to disk

- Deployment: Once the face mask detector is trained, we can then move on to loading the mask detector, performing face detection, and then classifying each face as with_mask or without_mask

We’ll review each of these phases and associated subsets in detail in the remainder of this tutorial, but in the meantime, let’s take a look at the dataset we’ll be using to train our COVID-19 face mask detector.


Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset as shown in Figure 3:

![Figure 3](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/face_mask_detection_dataset.jpg)

Figure 3: A face mask detection dataset consists of “with mask” and “without mask” images. 

The dataset we’ll be using here today was created by PyImageSearch reader Prajna Bhandary.

This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes:

- with_mask: 690 images
- without_mask: 686 images

Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether a person is or is not wearing a mask.

How was our face mask dataset created?
Prajna, like me, has been feeling down and depressed about the state of the world — thousands of people are dying each day, and for many of us, there is very little (if anything) we can do.

To help keep her spirits up, Prajna decided to distract herself by applying computer vision and deep learning to solve a real-world problem:

- Best case scenario — she could use her project to help others
- Worst case scenario — it gave her a much needed mental escape


## D.   PROJECT STRUCTURE

The dataset/ directory contains the data described in the “Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset” section.

Three image examples/ are provided so that you can test the static image face mask detector.

We’ll be reviewing three Python scripts in this tutorial:

- train_mask_detector.py: Accepts our input dataset and fine-tunes MobileNetV2 upon it to create our mask_detector.model. A training history plot.png containing accuracy/loss curves is also produced
- detect_mask_image.py: Performs face mask detection in static images
- detect_mask_video.py: Using your webcam, this script applies face mask detection to every frame in the stream

In the next two sections, we will train our face mask detector.



## E   TRAINING THE COVID-19 FACE MASK DETECTION

Figure 4: Figure 10: COVID-19 face mask detector training accuracy/loss curves demonstrate high accuracy and little signs of overfitting on the data

As you can see, we are obtaining ~99% accuracy on our test set.

Looking at Figure 4, we can see there are little signs of overfitting, with the validation loss lower than the training loss. 

Given these results, we are hopeful that our model will generalize well to images outside our training and testing set.


## F.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION

You can then launch the mask detector in real-time video streams using the following command:
- $ python detect_mask_video.py
- [INFO] loading face detector model...

Figure 5: Mask detector in real-time video streams

In Figure 5, you can see that our face mask detector is capable of running in real-time (and is correct in its predictions as well.



## G.   PROJECT PRESENTATION 

In this project, you learned how to create a COVID-19 face mask detector using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

To create our face mask detector, we trained a two-class model of people wearing masks and people not wearing masks.

We fine-tuned MobileNetV2 on our mask/no mask dataset and obtained a classifier that is ~99% accurate.

We then took this face mask classifier and applied it to both images and real-time video streams by:

- Detecting faces in images/video
- Extracting each individual face
- Applying our face mask classifier

Our face mask detector is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it’s also computationally efficient, making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, Jetosn, Nano, etc.).
